  "Summer EnVision Experience 2019 was a program that saw a team of ten UCSD undergraduates design, prototype, and deliver a VR Exhibit prototype to Birch Aquarium." +
  "\nLed by a PhD student and a world renowned artists, the team settled on creating robust kid friendly fish masks that played 360-video." +
  "\nThe team went through the following product design phases: Systems Requirement Review, Preliminary Design Review, Critical Design Review." +
  "\nMy job mainly dealt with software creation and hardware setup." +
  "\nI learned Unity, C#, and Batch Scripting to create the applications and systems necessary to make the entire product plug-and-play and intuitive to use." +
  "\nI also selected, tested, and analyzed the different hardware options we had to base the product off of." +
  "\nMy final contributions included the configurable app which looped 360 video on the Acer Mixed Reality Headset and" +
  "\nthe integration of the app and the hardware." +
  "\nI also picked up a lot of soft and design related skills." +
  "\nThe whole experience was very fun and memorable.";

  "\nAs a team, we aimed to prototype medical devices to help alleviate hand tremors in the elderly." +
  "\nI worked with the data collection team to create a glove to record and analyze hand tremors." +
  "\nTo that end, I designed circuits which integrated flex sensors and potentiomenters that could be fit onto a hand." +
  "\nI then used Python to read data from said sensors and successfully used that data to animate a hand model in Blender.";

  "SayWatt was a project that won 2nd place in IEEE Spring Quarterly Projects in 2019." +
  "\nThe idea was to build an app that can communicate with Arduino based devices that improved home automation." +
  "\nI worked in a team of 3, serving as the main hardware and software guy." +
  "\nUsing SolidWorks, I designed a light switch flipper that worked with Arduino servo motors." +
  "\nI programmed an ESP-8266 Microcontroller to communicate with an app created in React-Native." +
  "\nAssuming the light switch flippers were installed on light switches, the app can be used to turn those switches on and off." +
  "\nMy interest for IoT projects and networking stemmed mainly from this project.";
